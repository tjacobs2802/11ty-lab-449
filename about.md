<h2>{%highlight "Hello! My name is Trevor Jacobs"%}</h2>

 and I am the author of the Explorer Blog. 
Currently I am a fifth year senior at Michigan State University, and made this blog
as a class project. The goal I had in mind when making this was to be a host 
for anyone to share stories about their travels to anywhere, from antarctica to
space! Thank you for visiting this blog, take your time and enjoy the stories!
